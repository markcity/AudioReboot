# AudioReboot
A simple command for rebooting windows audio. Works for windows 10  11 ( untested in other versions)

It allows you to reboot the audio system in windows without having to reboot your machine.

Download to desktop and in properties, compatibility choose "Run this program as an administrator"

I use it when my audio gets stuck after using my DAW
